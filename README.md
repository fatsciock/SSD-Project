# Operational Analytics Project
Develop by: Negri Andrea, Spadoni Alberto

## Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/cityofLA/los-angeles-museum-visitors (Avila Adobe Museum)

## Goal
Build a predictive model to forecast the amount of future museum's visitors

## Highlights
- Trend identification
- Season identification (with seasonal coefficients)
- Model's type identification (additive or multiplicative)
- Combination of trend and seasonal coefficients to find a first simple "model" used to forecast 24 time periods
- SARIMA model used to forecast 24 time periods
- MLP model used to forecast 24 time periods
- LSTM model used to forecast 24 time periods
- Random Forest model used to forecast 24 time periods
- Diebold Mariano test to compare neural models (MLP-LSTM, MLP-RF, LSTM-RF)
